This .zip is for assignment 5. To compile and run all shell scripts for changing the 
CPU scheduler, run the script "HW5Shell.sh". This script will compile and runn all of the 
schedulings for the three programs I have written for high CPU usage, memory read intensive, and disk read intensive. The ProtectionDomain.sh script will show the list 
of commands needed for part 1 of the assignment.
